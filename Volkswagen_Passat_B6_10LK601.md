- Changed battery for a new start-stop one from Halfords (four years' warranty)
- Stop-Start now works, which is kind of good but also bad. 
- The battery cost EUR199 in Halfords and I was going to install it myself but I wasn't sure if I had to do something with a battery management computer to prevent over charging so I went to O'Connell Batteries, Unit J3, Marina Commercial Park, Cork to ask if it's necessary, and maybe get it fitted, and it wasn't necessary and I got it fitted but they charged me EUR50.
